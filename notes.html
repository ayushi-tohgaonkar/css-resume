 time and following through with that original

</pre>

<pre class="zzz">   I first started working on a new draft of my portfolio in 2011. I haven't been
    working on this update for two years, but I have been coming back to it ever few
    months. It's undergone countless iterations.

    Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like 
    when I would decide upon a certain direction, the web would up and change its
    game (think responsive design). This was more down to me taking my sweet time
    more than anything else.

    Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a 
    new portfolio. In a way I'm a little sad that the sketching / prototyping / designing /
    coding elements of the portfolio are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some 
    flourishes in the coming weeks and months (I've been toying with snap svg which 
    I'm looking forward to integrating).

    In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while 
    building out this site - inspiration, evolution, content management, execution. 
    Hopefully it may be of some use to those starting out with building their first 
    portfolio - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!
